 * Brenda Feldman
 * what's that .
 * A poem I have written for Brenda Feldman
 * Of course it is .
 * I put my thoughts into words , and now my words into actions.
 * I'll give you fifty bucks not to do this .
 * I'm eleven years old , what am i gonna do with the money
 * what you gonna do with a sixteen-year-old ?
 * He's like a bullfighter .
 * you ever see a bullfight ?
 * You're in such a bad mood , and I know why ? Because that man thought you're my father.
 * No - Yes. - No.
 * When you say "No" like that , it's always "Yes"
 * Come on , we're in the mall . Let's get you like some younger clothes .
 * There's a store there .
 * I don't need any younger clothes .
 * I don't care what some jackass in pair of ripped jeans thinks about me .
 * Yes , you shouldn't. you should only care what I think.
 * I love you , I don't care how old you are .
 * So , stop being a gloomy goose and stop being so hard on Manny.
 * The only reason I'm hard on Manny . Is just because I don't wanna he make a fool of himself.
 * I can smell his hair goo of his from here .
 * Look , I don't know what gonna happen to him over there . But you're his family now . and that means only one thing . -- You be the wind in his back , not the spit in his face .
 * What ?
 * It's something my mon always said . It's gorgeous in Spanish .
 * Look , he's there .
 * She has a boyfriend .
 * Oh , I'm sorry.
 * I gave her my heart , and she gave me a picture of me as an old-time sheriff .
 * It's Brave right Jay ? Brave.
 * You'll be better next time.
 * Come on , let's get a pretzel .
 * Uh , execute me sir , we ask all mall walker stay to the right .
